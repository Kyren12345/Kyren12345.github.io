            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>
                I obtained my undergraduate degree in Physics from the University of Montana in 2015. From there, I went on to work on a PhD in Geophysics with Dr. Craig Jones at the University of Colorado (CU). My research graduate research experience was broadly focused around western US tectonics with a strong emphasis on elastic wave propagation and full waveform modeling. During graduate school, I was an active participant in outreach activities including undergraduate student mentorship and K-12 outreach events. I also taught or TA-ed several geology and geophysics courses and spent two summers teaching pre-calculus for two CU affiliated pre collegiate development programs, one for Native American students and the other for potentially first generation college students.

                Upon defending, I went on to work full time as the Network Manager for the Colorado Geological Survey (CGS) seismic network. Here, my research focused transitioned more to Colorado and intraplate seismicity as well as exotic seismic events such as landslides and debris flows. As the sole employee at CGS responsible for the seismic network, I was responsible for equipment, field operations and data quality control. While at CGS, I also spearheaded the formalization of our outreach program and obtained the title of Outreach Coordinator.

                Currently, I am interested in seismicity, induced seismicity, machine learning, data processing, and elastic wave propagation. I am very curious about any type of novel seismic analysis techniques including the applications of low cost sensors such as Raspberry Shakes, and methods of examining the fundamental physics of wave propagation including gradiometry and other forms of array processing and full waveform analysis.
