            <p>
                Currently, I am interested in seismicity, induced seismicity, machine learning, data processing, and elastic wave propagation. I am very curious about any type of novel seismic analysis techniques including the applications of low cost sensors such as Raspberry Shakes, and methods of examining the fundamental physics of wave propagation including gradiometry and other forms of array processing and full waveform analysis.

            <p>
                I am also interested in education and public outreach.
